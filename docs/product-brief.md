# AirDraw Product Brief

## Overview
AirDraw is a pro-grade webcam drawing tool that lets artists sketch in mid-air using hand gestures. An on-device vision module tracks hand keypoints in real time and maps them to expressive brush strokes on a hardware accelerated canvas. A built‑in AI copilot turns natural language prompts into deterministic editor commands and reusable macros. Privacy is the default: camera frames stay local unless the user opts into cloud-powered features.

## Target Users
- Illustrators and designers who want fast ideation without touching a tablet
- Streamers and educators needing lightweight annotation
- Power users automating workflows via natural language macros

## Value Proposition
- Draw anywhere: no tablet or controller required
- Speed: <30 ms latency and 60 FPS for responsive strokes
- Control: rich gesture vocabulary and an AI assistant that understands commands
- Privacy: on-device vision and explicit consent for network calls

## User Stories
1. **As an artist**, I can pinch my fingers in front of the webcam to draw on the canvas so that I can sketch without hardware.
2. **As a power user**, I can ask the copilot, “new vector layer called line art,” and see a plan before it executes so that I maintain control.
3. **As a streamer**, I can show an open palm to bring up a radial palette and change colors while presenting.
4. **As a privacy‑conscious user**, I can toggle privacy mode to prevent any frame from leaving my machine.
5. **As a perfectionist**, I can undo/redo with a two‑finger swipe so that I can rapidly iterate.
6. **As a developer**, I can extend command mappings or swap out the vision model through stable interfaces.
